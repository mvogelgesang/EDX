                          In accordance with Federal policies, some Federal
                          agencies may require visitors to complete a COVID-19
                          vaccine self-attestation form indicating their
                          vaccination status. If the visitor is not fully
                          vaccinated or declines to respond, they may be
                          required to submit proof of a negative COVID-19 test
                          before access to the facility is granted. Agency
                          policies may vary depending on the nature of the
                          agency’s work, local conditions and other factors.
                          Prior to screening or picking up property at a Federal
                          facility, customers should contact the property
                          custodian or point of contact for information about
                          the facility’s policies, procedures and applicable
                          forms. An example COVID-19 Vaccination Attestation
