/* makes use of Sass nesting (https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import#nesting) to nest a given stylesheet within a class name. Doing so ensures that any global scope styles, e.g., body {}, h1 {}, etc do not impact the overall site css.

No need to reference the full directory or use the underscore that is included in the filename within _sass/.
